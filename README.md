# Jet-boundary-layer-equation
A model for heated buoyancy jet in stratified ambience on MATLAB platform

## Overview
This is a model for buoyant jets running in MATLAB platform. The goal is to model the **jet centerline velocity**, **jet centerline temperature**, **jet velocity half-width**, **jet temperature half-width**, and **jet trajectory**. This model provides a reliable representation of buoyant jet hydrodynamics under highly general flow conditions including:
- pure jets
- buoyant (positive and negative) jets
- pure plumes

And the ambient condition is allowed to be:
- non-stratification
- linear stratification
- two-layer stratification

## Example
Before introducing the theory base, it is better to illustrate some examples
