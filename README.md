# Jet-boundary-layer-equation
A model for heated buoyancy jet in stratified ambience on MATLAB platform

## Overview
This is a model for buoyant jets running in MATLAB platform. The goal is to model the **jet centerline velocity**, **jet centerline temperature**, **jet velocity half-width**, **jet temperature half-width**, and **jet trajectory**. This model provides a reliable representation of buoyant jet hydrodynamics under highly general flow conditions including:
- pure jets
- buoyant (positive and negative) jets
- pure plumes

And the ambient condition is allowed to be:
- non-stratification
- linear stratification
- two-layer stratification

## Example
Before introducing the theory base, it is better to illustrate some examples



## Theory of the boundary layer equation
This model is based on the paper published by Gersten in 1980, however, the model has been improved for the stratified ambience, which allows for various stratification types. Here is the brief introduction of the theory.
